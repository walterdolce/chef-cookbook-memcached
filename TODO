Implement libmemcached support

From documentation (https://code.google.com/p/memcached/wiki/NewInstallFromSource):

    "Note that many clients depend on libmemcached*. They either include it in their sources, or require an external build. You can follow the above practices for fetching and installing libmemcached as well."
